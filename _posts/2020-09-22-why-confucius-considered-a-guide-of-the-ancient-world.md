**Confucius** was one of the greatest philosophers of **Ancient China**. He lived in China during _500 BC_,and _was a teacher, magistrate, and chief minister of his city_. Later, he quit all official posts, and spent the rest of his life travelling from town to town around China with his students, giving advice to different rulers wherever he went. Due to the turmoil and injustices he saw, he set himself to develop a new moral code based on honesty, education, and strong family bonds.

**Confucius** believed that a _good government was the basis for a peaceful and happy society_. He taught that the _basis for a good government was good officials_. His teachings form a complex system of social, moral, political, and religious ideas that served as a guide for the individual and society, not only ancient China but throughout the ancient world.
