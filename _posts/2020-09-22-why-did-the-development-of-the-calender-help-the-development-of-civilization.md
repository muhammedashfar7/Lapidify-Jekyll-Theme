Ancient civilizations dependent on the movement of the _sun, moon, planets and star_ to measure the passage of time, and to determine the seasons, months, and years. In colder countries,the concept of the year was determined by the seasons. However, _in warmer countries, where the seasons are less pronounced, the Moon became the basic unit for counting time._

Most of the oldest calendars were **lunar calendars**, based on the time interval from one new moon to the next. Ice-age hunters in Europe over 20000 years ago scratched lines and gouged holes in sticks and bones, possibly counting the days between phases of the moon.

_The earliest **Egyptian calendar** was based on the moon's cycles, but later, the Egyptians devised a 365 day calendar._

On the other hand, the **Mayans** of **Central America** relied on not only the sun and moon, but also the planet Venus, to establish 260 day and 365 day calendars. Their calenders later became portions of the great Aztec calender stones. Other civilizations, including the modern West, have adopted a 365day solar calender with a leap year occurring every fourth year.
