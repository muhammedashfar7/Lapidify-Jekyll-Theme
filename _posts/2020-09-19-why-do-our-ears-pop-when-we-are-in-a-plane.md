The air high above the surface of the earth is less dense than air near the surface and as a result , its pressure is much lower than at the surface. So, the cabins of airplanes are pressurized to prevent the pilot and passengers from passing out, because of lack of air. The pressure of air in the cabin is usually less than outside air at high altitudes.
As a plane rises , the pressure decreases, and the air trapped in your inner ear will cause your eardrums to push outward, causing some discomfort. Your body equalizes the pressure between your inner ear and the atmosphere by allowing some air from your inner ear to escape through two small channels called the Eustachian tube, that connect the middle ear to the throat, one on each side. As the pressure is released, you will hear a 'popping' sound.
