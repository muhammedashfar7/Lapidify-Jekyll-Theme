The Chinese first discovered gunpowder in their search for a magic mixture that would grant a person eternal life. They stumbled upon its explosive qualities quite accidently while experimenting with saltpeter, a waste product of bacteria that feeds on decaying organic matter.

Saltpeter appeared in many parts of china as white crust in the topsoil. Gunpowder was the first used mainly for fireworks and for show, but pretty soon, the Chinese learned that it could be used to make deadly weapons too. These weaponed included 'flying fire', an arrow with a burning tube of gun powder attached to the shaft.

By the 12th century, the Chinese were packing gunpowder into hardened containers to produce bombs. Later, they mastered the art of packing gunpowder into metal tube with an open end to launch bits of metal and crockery at high speed. These were the first guns Gradually, the guns became heavier, and they were mounted on wheels to make the very first canons.
