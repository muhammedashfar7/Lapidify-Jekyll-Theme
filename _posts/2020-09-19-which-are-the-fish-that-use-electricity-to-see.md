Some species of fish that live in the murky waters of tropical rivers use electricity to see. They do this by sending out electrical pulses, and navigate their way through dark water by detecting how the pulse are altered. The African Knife Fish and Nile fish send out a stream of electric pulses and any obstacle in its path including other fish alters the pattern of the pulses. This change is detected by special sense organs in the fish's head, allowing it to 'see' accurately, even in darkness, in spite of the fact that its eyesight is very poorly developed.
