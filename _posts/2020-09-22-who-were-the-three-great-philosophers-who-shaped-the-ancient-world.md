**Socrates**, **plato** and **Aristotle** were three great philosophers whose ideas shaped the ancient world.

**Socrates** was the first to make a clear distinction between the body and soul. He said that the soul was actually more important than the body. He had an enquiring mind, and taught by asking questions about life. Some people did not like his teachings, and his noble man was finally put to death. His teachings were written down by Plato, his student.

**Plato** founded a school of philosophy called _the Academy_, which is believed to be the first university in the western world. **Plato's** most important work was 'The Republic', in which he explains philosophy.

**Aristotle** was a student of **plato**, and studied at _the Academy_. He later founded his own school of philosophy called **_The Lyceum_**. His most important contribution may have been his invention of logic, and his theories have influenced the western world of centuries.
