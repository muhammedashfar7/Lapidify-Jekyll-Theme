Glass is an inorganic solid material that is usually clear or translucent with different colors. Before people learned to make glass, they had found two forms of natural glass. When lightening strikes sand, the heat sometimes fuses the sand into long, slender glass tubes called fulgurites. The terrific heat of a volcanic eruption also sometimes fuses rocks and sand into a glass called obsidian. In early times, people shaped obsidian into knives, arrowheads , jewelry, and money. Glass was probably invented around 3000BC . It is generally believed that the first manufactured glass was in the form of a glaze on ceramic vessels.

Modern glass originated in Alexandria when artisans created 'mosaic glass' in which slices of coloured glass were used to create decorative patterns.

Early glassmaking was slow and costly, and it required hard work. Glass blowing was invented about 30 BC by the glassmakers of Syria. This invention made glass production easier, faster, and cheaper. As a result , glass became available to the common people for the first time.

Today, glass is used for various kinds of bottles and utensils, mirrors, windows and many other things.
