Around six hundred years ago, books were handwritten. Johannes Gutenberg was the man who saved people the trouble of writing books by hand, by inventing the printing press. Johannes started hid invention by making metal letters. He arranged them into a sentence , and pressed pieces of paper against the letters that had ink on them, with his hands. However , the ink did nay come out evenly on to the paper , so he decided to make a press.\
Gutenberg took some existing technologies and some of his own inventions to come up with the printing press in the year 1450. One key idea he came up with was moveable type. Rather than use wooden blocks to press ink onto paper, Gutenberg used moveable metal pieces to quickly create pages.
