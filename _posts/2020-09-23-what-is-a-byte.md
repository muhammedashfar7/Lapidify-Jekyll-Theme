Before discussing what a **byte** is, you must know what a '**bit**' is. A bit is a unit, that at all times, has one of two possible values. The two values are '**on**' and '**off**'. Computer programmers use the numbers **0** and **1** to represent these two values. 0 stands for 'off', and 1 stands for 'on'. Thus , a bit that is off has the value 0 and a bit that is on, has the value 1. A group of *8 bits forms a byte*. Bits are grouped into bytes to separate one piece of information from the next. Bytes are used to measure the amount of information a device can store.
