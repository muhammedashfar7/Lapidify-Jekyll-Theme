**Cloning** is the process of creating an identical copy of an organism. Our bodies are made up of billions of cells. Each of these cells has a copy of all the genetic information needed by the body. This is called the genetic code.

This means that each cell of our body has enough information to create another person exactly like us. But to do this, we need egg cell, the single cell which we have all grown. This egg cell divides millions of times to give rise to the millions of cells which form our body.

In the process of cloning, the scientists extract the DNA that contains genetic code from an animal cell, and implant it into an egg cell taken from another animal. Before implanting it, the DNA of the second animal is removed. In this way, a carbon copy of the first animal is created, and this is called a clone.
