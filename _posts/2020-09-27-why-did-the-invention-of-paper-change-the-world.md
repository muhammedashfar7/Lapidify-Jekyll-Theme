Since the invention of writing, people had been trying to come up with something to write on that was easy and cheap to make. Paper seems to have been invented around 100BC in China.

A government official in china named Ts'ai Lun was the first to start a paper-making  industry. Ts'ai Lun seems  to have made his paper by mixing finely chopped mulberry bark and hemp rags with water , mashing it flat, and then pressing out the water, and letting it dry in the sun.

Even after people in China began to use paper, it took another thousand years before people were using paper all over Eurasia. By the 400's AD, people in India were also marking paper. Paper gets its name from the Egyptian papyrus plant that was used to make paper-like sheets as early as 2300BC.
